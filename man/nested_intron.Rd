\title{Identify nested introns and assign intron clusters}
\usage{
nested_intron(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame containing at least the columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{gene}: gene identifier
\item \code{Start}: intron start coordinate (numeric)
\item \code{End}: intron end coordinate (numeric)
}}
}
\value{
A data.frame with two new columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Nested}: classification of each intron as "Parent", "Nested", or "Orphan"
\item \code{Intron_cluster}: cluster number for each parent–nested group (orphans remain "X")
}
}
\description{
For each gene in a data frame of introns, classify introns as
\emph{Parent}, \emph{Nested}, or \emph{Orphan} based on genomic coordinates.
Parent introns contain at least one smaller intron within their span,
Nested introns fall completely inside a parent intron, and Orphan introns
do not overlap other introns. The function also assigns a cluster number
(\code{Intron_cluster}) to each parent–nested group.
}
\details{
Introns are processed gene by gene. For each intron, overlaps are used
to determine whether it contains other introns (Parent), is contained
within another (Nested), or stands alone (Orphan). Parent–nested groups
are assigned unique cluster numbers for downstream analysis.
